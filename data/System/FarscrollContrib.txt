---++ Summary
%STARTSECTION{"summary"}%
This simple plugin enhances elements that have a overflowing fixed width but no
fixed height, the ones with the horizontal scrollbar like pre. If the element
overlaps the page fold the scrollbar is not visible. With this Plugin a cloned
scrollbar is positioned over the element when needed.
